## Background Images

Simple example of using images as backgrounds using `background-image` alongside `background-repeat`.
`background-repeat` behaves similarly to `object-fit`. In fact the former got inspired by the later, as developers used to avoid using `<img />` because there was no equivalent to `background-image` on them!
